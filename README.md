USA Traffic Accident Analysis
Project Overview
This project utilizes Power BI to analyze traffic accident data across the United States. The goal is to identify patterns and trends related to road conditions, weather, and time of day, and to visualize accident hotspots and contributing factors. By analyzing this data, we aim to provide insights that can help improve road safety and reduce the frequency of traffic accidents.

Data Source
The dataset used in this project contains detailed information on traffic accidents in the USA. The key columns include:

ID: Unique identifier for each accident
Source: Data source of the accident record
Severity: Severity of the accident (e.g., 1-4)
Start Time: Date and time when the accident started
End Time: Date and time when the accident ended
Start_Lat: Latitude of the accident start location
Start_Lng: Longitude of the accident start location
End_Lat: Latitude of the accident end location
End_Lng: Longitude of the accident end location
Distance: Distance covered during the accident
Description: Text description of the accident
Street, City, State, Zipcode: Location details
Weather Condition: Weather condition at the time of the accident
Temperature, Wind Speed, Humidity, etc.: Meteorological data
Road Conditions: Information on road conditions at the time of the accident (e.g., wet, icy)
Sunrise/Sunset: Whether the accident occurred during sunrise, sunset, or nighttime
Other Factors: Presence of traffic signals, crossings, junctions, etc.
Power BI Solution Overview
The analysis focuses on the following key steps:

1. Data Import and Preparation
Data Import: Load the traffic accident dataset into Power BI.
Data Cleaning: Clean the data by removing duplicates and handling missing values.
Geospatial Data Integration: Use latitude and longitude data to map accidents geographically.
2. Key Analysis and Visualizations
Create the following visualizations to uncover patterns in the traffic accident data:

Accident Severity by Location:

A heatmap showing accident severity across different states and cities, helping to identify high-risk areas.
Time of Day Analysis:

A line chart visualizing the distribution of accidents throughout the day, highlighting peak accident times.
Weather Impact on Accidents:

A bar chart or column chart analyzing the correlation between weather conditions (e.g., fog, rain, snow) and the frequency of accidents.
Accident Hotspots:

A map visualization identifying geographic hotspots where accidents frequently occur.
Severity Distribution:

A pie chart or donut chart showing the proportion of accidents by severity level.
Road Condition Analysis:

A clustered bar chart comparing accident frequencies under different road conditions (e.g., dry, wet, icy).
Sunrise/Sunset Impact:

A stacked bar chart analyzing the frequency of accidents during sunrise, sunset, and nighttime.
Weather and Road Condition Cross Analysis:

A matrix or heatmap showing the relationship between weather conditions and road conditions in accident occurrence.
3. Insights and Recommendations
Accident Hotspots: Identify high-risk areas that may need better traffic management or safety measures.
Time-Based Patterns: Insights into peak accident times, guiding law enforcement for better resource allocation.
Weather and Road Condition Impact: Understanding how weather and road conditions contribute to accidents can help in issuing timely warnings to drivers
